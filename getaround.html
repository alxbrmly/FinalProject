            <h3>The Staten Island Ferry</h3>
            <p><img id="transit-photo" src="img/si-ferry.jpg">If you are staying in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, or Queens, and want to take public transportation, the ferry is the best bet.
            </p>

            <h3>Staten Island Railway (SIR)</h3>
            <p><img id="transit-photo" src="img/sir1.jpg">Staten Island is unique in that it does not have an underground subway like the four boroughs. Instead it has an above ground railway system that starts at St. George ferry and runs along the eastern side of the island.
            </p>
            <p>The SIR schedule varies between rush hours and off-peak hours, check the schedule <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/service/pdf/sircur.pdf">here</a>. The train is free at every station except Tompinskinville and St. George, you must pay to enter and exit the SIR system at these two stations. You pay for SIR with the NYC Metrocard, you can purchase or refill your Metrocard at Tompkinsville or St. George.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Directions:</strong> From the ferry, follow the signs for the SIR and swipe your Metrocard to enter, follow the signs for local and express trains.</p>

            <h3>MTA Bus</h3>
            <p><img id="transit-photo" src="img/si-bus.jpg">Because Staten Island does not have a subway system, it has an extensive system of buses that run all over the Island. There's even two buses that run between Staten Island and Brooklyn and one that runs between Staten Island and Bayonne, New Jersey.
            </p>
            <p>Most buses start and end their trips at the St. George Ferry Terminal. You can check which buses start from the ferry <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/maps/bussi.pdf">here</a>. All buses in Staten Island use NYC MTA Metrocard, the current fare is 2.75 a ride for regular buses. If you wish to take express buses back to the city, the fare is $6.50, express buses do not enter the ferry terminal.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Directions:</strong> From inside the St. George terminal, you can follow the signs for Ramps A, B, C, D to figure out where to catch your bus. Express bus stops are scattered throughout the island, so it's best to find the stop closest to your cross-street.
